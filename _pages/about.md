Hi, I'm Luigi and I'm a Computer Science student at University of Salerno.  
Currently I'm following a Master course about *Cloud Computing*, which is my main focus now but I have also interest in distributed computing, algorithms and operating systems.  

Other than a job, Computer Science is a passion that follows me since I got my first computer 15 years ago and became part of who I am now. This makes me a very curious and enterprising person, always ready to learn something new, but also a very dedicated person who is not afraid of working hard to achieve his objectives. 

But working hard alone is not what this science was made for: I learned to work as a team during my early years at university, that teached me how to manage difficulties, but mostly during my activity as Red Cross rescuer, where I figured out what being part of a team really means.   

When you have a passion, nothing is more satisfying to pass it on: during my Master degree years I'm regularly taking tutouring course for undergraduate students (some materials about can be found [here](www.google.it)), while in my free time I used to give private lesson.  

Beside university, my greatest passion is cooking, expecially **Pastry** üç∞: I spend hours trying to plan my next masterpiece, checking every details trying to make it more yummy as possibile (when I don't just destroy it missing a passage). What makes pastry so fascinating is its basic simplicity, which might lead to think that it's not a big deal but, as Maestro Massari says:

>*"La semplicit√† non ammette errori"*
